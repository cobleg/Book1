Welcome!

This is a minimal example of a book based on R Markdown and **bookdown** (<https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown>).

This template provides a skeleton file structure that you can edit to create your book.

The contents inside the .Rmd files provide some pointers to help you get started, but feel free to also delete the content in each file and start fresh.

Additional resources:

# Dear future me

I know you will forget key details about producing and publishing technical reports using Bookdown, so I have added specific bits of information that are not included in the standard Minimal Example under the heading: Additional Information.
